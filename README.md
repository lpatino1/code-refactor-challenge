# code-refactor-challenge

## Description

I refactored the code to follow accessibility standards. This enables the website to be more accessible for screenreaders. It was my first venture in refactoring and I learned how to clean up code and get rid of redundant code. I also learned to what extent I am able to refactor and I am eager to hear back feedback on how I can improve this code further.

## Installation
